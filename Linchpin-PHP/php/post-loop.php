Describing such a complex product presents a challenge, but doing so can be empowering: it can help a person or a company understand what they like, make more informed purchasing decisions, and identify and track product quality over time. In order to help guide these descriptions, many food and beverage industries have developed flavor wheels. A flavor wheel, simply put, is a circle of words.
